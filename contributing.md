# ðŸ¤— Contributing

## Getting Started
When contributing, we suggest you develop an understanding of the languages used within the project. Rungeon is written in JavaScript, CSS, Bootstrap, and HTML. 
If you plan to make visual changes familiarize yourself with CSS & Bootstrap, we assume you are already competent with JavaScript & HTML. 

## We Develop with GitHub
We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.
If you have little to no experience with GitHub, we suggest you [check this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iv8rSLsi1xo), it outlines the basics you need to get started. 

## General Pull Request
Here are the simplified steps for an issue/feature related pull request:
  - Find an issue or a feature that you would like to add.
  - Fork the repository and find it under `your-username/rungeon`
  - Clone the repo to your local machine via `git clone https://github.com/devkennyy/rungeon.git`
  - Create a new branch for your fix by running `git checkout -b branch-name`
  - Modify the code for your issue/feature. 
  - Add and commit the changes `git commit -am "changes made"`
  - Submit your pull request.

## Stage Pull Request
Here are the simplified steps for an issue/feature related pull request:
  - Understand how you want the stage to work and the stage number. 
  - Find an icon that will fit your stage [here](https://fontawesome.com/v5/cheatsheet/free/solid). 
  - Fork the repository and find it under `your-username/rungeon`
  - Clone the repo to your local machine via `git clone https://github.com/devkennyy/rungeon.git`
  - Create a new branch for your stage by running `git checkout -b stage-number`
  - Start by copy/pasting this stage template before the `stage_end` div:
```html
    <div id="stage_z" class="stage d-flex flex-column flex-nowrap vh-100 d-none">
      
      <div id="stage_z-icon" class="icon fas fa-icon fa-3x align-self-center" onclick="Stage_Specific_Function"></div>
      <h1>First line</h1>
      <p>Second line</p>
      <div class="d-flex justify-content-center">
        <button class="btn btn-danger me-5" onclick="Previous_Stage(z)">Return</button>
        <button id="stage_z-btn" class="btn btn-primary" disabled onclick="Next_Stage(z)">Continue</button>
      </div>
    </div>
```
  - Replace instances of `z` with your stage number (previous stage + 1)
  - Edit the h1, paragraph, and icon text as you see fit. (e.g. 2 fa-egg, fa-monkey). 
  - If your stage requires a unique function, create one in `main.js` and make sure the name matches the `onclick()` of any element. 
  - Test thoroughly and ensure the stage guidelines below.
  - Add and commit the changes `git add .`, `git commit -m "changes made"`
  - Submit your pull request with screenshots.

## Stage Guidelines
  - Format your code with Prettier before submitting. 
  - Ensure your contributions are safe for work. 
  - Make sure your stage follows the template and isn't completely different. 
  - Be sure to increment the `totalStages` variable (previous count plus 1). 
  - Check that your stage isn't similar to any other level. 
  - Test your stage multiple times to ensure it works as it should. 
  - Make sure to make to revert hidden elements within the `Reset_Stage` function.
